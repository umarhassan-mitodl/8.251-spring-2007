description: A torus is built from a cylinder of circumference 2p and length T by
  gluing the edges with a twist angle ?. The set of inequivalent tori is represented
  by the points in the orange region. In all these tori the shortest geodesic has
  length greater than or equal to 2p. (Image by MIT OpenCourseWare.)
