  caption: "A torus is built from a cylinder of circumference 2\u03C0 and length T\
    \ by gluing the edges with a twist angle \u03B8. The set of inequivalent tori\
    \ is represented by the points in the orange region. In all these tori the shortest\
    \ geodesic has length greater than or equal to 2\u03C0. (Image by MIT OpenCourseWare.)"
